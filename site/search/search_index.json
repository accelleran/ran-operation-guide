Introduction \u00b6 This guide describes how to operate the Accelleran ORAN 5G Platform and the different network components (RIC, CU, DU and L1). The scope of this document is therefore to cover only the operational aspects of the platform, including the basic configuration and examples of some test cases. This means that the installation and initial configuration of the System has been already made by Accelleran Customer Support and there is no need to worry about how to prepare the server, install and initialise the components. 2022.4.0 release include Accelleran Cell Wrapper, which works as a layer on top of the DU and RU. This provides a common interface for configuration and controls over a cell. It monitors a DU and RU through periodic health checks and uses the control interface internally to attempt an automatic repair from failures. These health checks include checks for reachability, traffic, container status and checks on a set of log messages. 2.

In the following sections the below example network would be configured to support handover between the cells. As an example to configure the below setup for handover. 1. Prerequists \u00b6 There are a couple of requirements: The same CU-CP is used by the two cells using different DUs. (Inter-DU). The two cells must operate in the same frequency (Intra Frequency). The two DUs must have be configured with unique Cell ID, PCI, and gNB-DU-ID. (Extra care must be taken into selecting the PCI to prevent cases of PCI conflict or PCI confusion) The UE must be using a slice that is available on both serving cell and target cell. Otherwise the UE won't find the slice it is currently using on the target cell and hence never trigger a handover. PS: In cases where the CU configuration was changed. Remember to click submit on the cell configuration as well. This will restart the cells to use the latest configuration of the CU. 2. DU Handover Configuration \u00b6 Using the cell wrapper, the configuration of the two cells can be modified/viewed. From the dashboard go to RAN Overview then 5G From the DU/RU List , click on configuration. Note down the cell ID and PCI for each of the cells. (They would be later be used to populate the neighbor cell list in the CU) 3. CU Handover Configuration \u00b6 Neighbor cell list must be configured in the CU-CP to let the UE know which cells to measure and when to trigger event A3 and handover to the neighbor cell. From the dashboard go to RAN Overview then 5G From the CU-CP List , click on configuration. Add two neighbor relations. One from cell1 to cell2 and the other is from cell2 to cell1. Extra care must be taken into below settings: \"NR Cell ID\": is the NR cell Identity which is 36 bit combination of the gNB-ID and the cell ID. Assuming the gNB-ID was 1 and it is 27 bits. Then in our example: cell1 will have 513 and cell2 is 514. \"gNB-id\" and \"gnb-id-length\" can be viewed from the Complete cucp-1 Configuration at the bottom of the Configuration Window.

Multi Slice Configuration \u00b6 To enable multiple slices support for a cell, the different components of the network must be configured to support them. As an example, Assuming we want to configure three slices: (SST:1), (SST:1,SD:1), (SST2) 1.1. CU-UP Multi Slice Configuration \u00b6 Here, the CU UP must be configured with all the Slices that the Core and the Cell will be configured with to support. From the dashboard go to RAN Overview then 5G From the CU-UP List , click on configuration. Set Admin State to Locked. (To allow changing the CU configuration) Add the different slices in the Supported PLMN Slices and then submit. SD 16777215 (0xFFFFFF) = no SD, SST 1 = eMBB, SST 2 = URLLC 1.2. DU Multi Slice Configuration \u00b6 Similar to the CU UP, the DU must be configured with the slices that it needs to support. From the dashboard go to RAN Overview then 5G From the DU/RU List , click on configuration. Add the different slices in the Supported PLMN Slices and then submit. SD 16777215 (0xFFFFFF) = no SD, SST 1 = eMBB, SST 2 = URLLC 1.3. Core MOCN Configuration \u00b6 The core connected should support the slices enabled on the cell. In our example the core should be configured with (SST:1), (SST:1,SD:1), (SST2). As core configuration would be done differently based on which core vendor is used. It wouldn't be part of this document. Please contact Accelleran with the details of the core used to provide support if possible. 2. MOCN Configuration \u00b6 To configure the Cell to support MOCN (Multi-Operator Core Network) scenarios In order to obtain a working setup with MOCN, it is essential that all the network components are aligned and configured coherently to serve the same list of PLMNIDs. As an example, this section will show how to configure the below scenario, where one cell will broadcast two PLMNIDs so that UE1 will connect to Core1 and UE2 will connect to Core2. 2.1. CU-CP MOCN Configuration \u00b6 Simply the CU-CP must be configured with all the addresses to the cores that are needed. From the dashboard go to RAN Overview then 5G From the CU-CP List , click on configuration. Set Admin State to Locked. (To allow changing the CU configuration) Add the first and second core IPs to the NG Address list and then submit. 2.2. CU-UP MOCN Configuration \u00b6 Here, the CU UP must be configured with all the PLMNIDs and Slices that the Core and the Cell will be configured with to support. (Assuming there is only one slice \"SST1, SD:0\" configured on each of the cores) From the dashboard go to RAN Overview then 5G From the CU-UP List , click on configuration. Set Admin State to Locked. (To allow changing the CU configuration) Add the first and second PLMN IDs to the Supported PLMN Slices and then submit. 2.3. DU MOCN Configuration \u00b6 Similar to the CU UP, the DU must be configured with the PLMN IDs and slices that it needs to support. From the dashboard go to RAN Overview then 5G From the DU/RU List , click on configuration. Add the first and second PLMN IDs to the Supported PLMN Slices and then submit. 2.4.

Please contact Accelleran if your Radio End is not included in any section of this user guide 1. Parameter Configuration \u00b6 1.1. Configuring Center Frequency \u00b6 Take into account that if system release 2022.4.0 is used, adjusting the center frequency will require applying the change on the RU and on the DU (extra step shown below). 1.1.1. Finding a Proper Frequency \u00b6 There are several limitations on the Frequencies that can be selected: The selected frequency should be within the band supported by the hardware (RAN650/RAN550) used. The selected frequency must be devisable by 3.84 Subcarrier Spacing = 30KHz Bandwidth = 40MHz The K_ssb must be 0 The offset to point A must be 6 Let's proceed with an example: To set a center frequency of 3750 MHz, this is not devisable by 3.84, the nearest frequencies that meet this condition are 3747.84MHz (976 3.84) 3751.68MHz (977 3.84) so let's consider first 3747,84 MHz and verify the conditions on the K_ssb and Offset to Point A with this online tool (link at: (https://www.sqimway.com/nr_refA.php) ) On the tool set the Band to 78, SCS to 30KHz, the Bandwidth to 40MHz and the ARFCN of the center frequency 3747,84 which is 649856 and when we hit the RUN button we obtain: This Frequency, however does not meet the GSCN Synchronisation requirements as in fact the Offset to Point A of the first channel is 2 and the K_ssb is 16, this will cause the UE to listen on the wrong channel so the SIBs will never be seen and therefore the cell is \"invisible\" We then repeat the exercise with the higher center frequency 3751.68MHz, which yelds a center frequency ARFCN of 650112 and a point A ARFCN of 648840 and giving another run we will see that now the K_ssb and the Offset to Point A are correct. 1.1.2. Applying The Frequency Change \u00b6 (Through the cell wrapper) - From the dashboard go to \"RAN Overview\" then \"5G\" - From the DU/RU list, find the cell to be changed and Click on \"configuration\". - For our example where the center frequency required is 3751.68MHz which is ARFCN 650112.

This won't be the same with the next system release.","title":"Split 2 Cell Operation"},{"location":"nodeh-du-ru-operation/#1-startstop-cell","text":"ssh into the DU/RU unit and run below command to start the cell. systemctl start nodeh-5g To stop the cell: systemctl stop nodeh-5g Because of a bug in the L1 of this release, To start the cell again, a reboot maybe necessary on the unit. So just run reboot on the unit and then ssh into it again and run systemctl start nodeh-5g . The unit usually boot up very fast.","title":"1.
